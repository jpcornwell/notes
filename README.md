Temporary scratchpad

## challenges
* microcorruption
* cryptopals
* starfighters.io
* over-the-wire
* smash the stack
* project euler
* rosalind
* http://escape.alf.nu/
* that one site with all of the suggestions (need to check my bookmarks)

## ideas for projects
* chess programs
* emulators
* game engines and games
* tools/libraries for challenges
* AI
* prog language (parser, interpreter, compiler, linter)
* write you a haskell
* japanese learning
* cryptography
* tools for basic investment and finance stuff

## misc
* get a list of blogs I like to check regularly
* math - helps stay mentally active, improves logic abilities, can tie into programming
* philosophy - to live a happy life
* history - to learn from the actions of the past and better understand the curent and how humans think (also can provide inspiration by means of great individuals)
* politics - to keep from being taken advantage of
* economics - to provide for oneself
* arts
* - art, architecture, literature, music, video games, etc.
* games
* - chess
* games to look into
* - peg solitaire, connect four, sokoban

## cool stuff to look into
* asm.js
* operating systems
* graphics
* demoscene
* visualizations (discrete math, data strucutres, algorithms)

## reminder
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell
* https://www.amazon.com/Haskell-Logic-Programming-Second-Computing/dp/0954300696
* pro html5 games (author made web command and conquer)

## programming languages to focus on
* haskell - purely functional
* javascript - many benefits to web applications
* C# - object oriented
* C/C++ - lower level, used for MANY applications, especially games
* assembly - even lower level
* python - simple and quick while still standardized and conservative
* perl - fun, a programmer's programming language
