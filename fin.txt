  what is a bank
    institution that deals in money and provides financial services, accepts
     deposits and lends money out, will derive profit by the difference in 
     interest rates charged and interest rates paid, can profit from other
     things too such as investments
  how banks operate
    amount of lending is directly affected by the reserve requirement set by
     the Federal Reserve
    highly regulated by government
  why use a bank

if a you have issues with your bank that are not resolved by the manager
  then contact CFPB (consumer financial protection bureau)

  typically have better rates than banks
  are typically smaller, may be better for local use, but worse for people who travel internationally
